## 📖 Project Overview  

This repository is a comprehensive collection of notebooks focusing on **linear regression**, **data preprocessing**, and **data imputation techniques**. It is designed to provide step-by-step explanations, practical implementations, and insights into these crucial concepts for anyone diving deep into data science or machine learning.  

The repository includes topics like:  
- Linear Regression, including Ridge and Polynomial variants.  
- Various Gradient Descent techniques.  
- Feature engineering and preprocessing.  
- Data imputation strategies (e.g., Mean/Median Imputation, KNN Imputation).  
- Outlier detection and handling.  
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA).

## 🧰 Tech Stack and Libraries  

- **Python** 🐍: The core language used.  
- **Jupyter Notebook** 📓: For interactive, well-documented code.  
- **Libraries Used**:  
  - `numpy`  
  - `pandas`  
  - `scikit-learn`  
  - `matplotlib`  
  - `seaborn`

## 🎯 Motivation  

The motivation behind this project stems from my desire to gain a thorough understanding of key foundational concepts in data science and machine learning. By exploring these topics in-depth and implementing them step by step, I not only solidified my knowledge but also created a resource that others can use to learn or revise these concepts.  

Each notebook is an **assessment of specific tasks or challenges** that simulate real-world scenarios. For instance:  
- Why so many imputation techniques? **To explore how different methods impact model accuracy and feature distributions.**  
- Why Ridge Regression and Gradient Descent? **To understand and implement techniques that address overfitting and optimize model training.**  

These assessments allowed me to experiment, learn, and prepare for practical applications in advanced projects.
